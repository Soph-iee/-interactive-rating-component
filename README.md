## My process

I started with styling the markup by using a flexbos display on the body to in a bid to center the container. i imported the fonts, sectioned the markup into classes and stlyed them accordingly. However, when I started making the project interactive using Javascript, Ihad to change and add new classes. ( The rating numbers, their hover states), Using Javascript, I ended repeating a number of codes because I could not think out a way to make the codes consise and effective. At the end, I wrote the codes to build the project to replicate the images provided.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me refresh some javascript basics that I have learnt. Handling click events, manipulating the DOM, writing functions.

### Continued development

I still need to learn how write shorter and more effective codes. in essence, codes that are not lrnthy but does what the long codes does.
